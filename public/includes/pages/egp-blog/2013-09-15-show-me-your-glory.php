    'During Israel’s wilderness journey, God had grown so tired of them being defiantly set in their ways that didn’t honor Him, that He said if He “went with them” to the Promised Land, He would destroy them on the way. In fact, they’d reached the point where God said He would give the land to their descendants instead of them. ([bible to="Exodus 33:1-3" /])'

    'Even though the majority of Israel consistently rejected God, He honored the faith of the few…including Joshua, who has a strong craving for the Presence of God. ([bible to="Exodus 33:11" /]) We also see a similar message in [bible to="2 Chronicles 7:14" /] (NASB), “My people who are called by My Name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”'

    'The word translated as “back” can be translated as “behind” or “afterward”. In this passage, it could carry more of the connotation of, “you shall see where I just was.” So, while Moses couldn’t see the Father’s Glory directly, he could see the Radiance (i.e., light, heat, emission) of His Glory.'
