    'The Bible refers to marriage as a “covenant before God.” ([bible to="Malachi 2:14" /]) The word translated as “covenant” ([strongs id="h1285" /]) in the Old Testament comes from the word meaning “to cut.” This is a reference to how covenants were made during that time. Clean animals were cut in two parts, and those making the covenant walked between them. This was a symbolism of the sacrifices that covenants entail and showed the dedication and commitment of both parties.'

    'Upon the creation of man, God is pictured as noting man’s incompleteness and lack of perfect happiness apart from woman. When God made woman He made her to be man’s helper and companion. In the [bible to="Genesis 2"]second chapter of Genesis[/bible], God refers to the woman’s position as a “suitable helper;” this literally translates as a “helping counterpart.” The word “counterpart” comes from two words. “Counter” means, “to act in response, move back and forth alternately, give and receive mutually, to be opposite in direction or position.” The word “part” is defined as, “a distinct piece or portion that fulfills a specific function in the working of a whole, one’s proper share of an obligation, performance, or participation.”'

    'The man makes up one side, the woman makes up the other side, and together they make a circle. The only way to fill that circle is with Christ. Without Christ, the circle is left frail, empty…hollow. Christ is the center, the very seal of the covenant. Without Christ as the center and seal, the marriage is no more than a contract…merely a fragile promise between two people. [bible to="Hebrews 13:4" /] says to, “Give honor to marriage, and remain faithful to one another in marriage.” The word translated as “honored” means “being of exceptional value, precious, a high status that merits esteem and respect.”'

For one of the most intimate and difficult of human relationships is that of marriage. Infinitely rewarding at best, unspeakably oppressive at its worst, marriage offers the uttermost extremes of human happiness and human bondage—with all the lesser degrees of felicity and restraint in-between.'
