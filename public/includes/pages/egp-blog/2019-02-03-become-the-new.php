When you bring DESPAIR, all you SEE is despair. When you bring ANGER, all you SEE is anger. When you bring BETRAYAL, all you SEE is betrayal. And God’s trying to give you NEW EYES so you can see the NEW FUTURE He has for you. … God wants you to REMEMBER your past, but He does not want you to LIVE in your past. …'
