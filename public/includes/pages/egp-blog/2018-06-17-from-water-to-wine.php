      '“Each miracle of Jesus had prophetic significance. When He turned the water into wine, His first miracle, He was demonstrating one of the most important, initial lessons we should learn as we start to follow Him. The vessels were set aside and filled with water. Water is often symbolic of the Word of God. This was the period of preparation in which they were to be ‘filled to the brim’ with His teaching.

Those who are poured out too soon seldom ever become ‘wine’ or walk in the fullness of the anointing to which they have been called. The ‘water’ they serve is refreshing and may bless many, but … those who have waited to become wine have shaken the world!'
