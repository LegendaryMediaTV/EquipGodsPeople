    'Let me start by saying that there is nothing wrong with crying, weeping, or mourning. In fact, we are commanded to weep. [bible to="Romans 12:15" /] says, “Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.” We can do this because God “comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.”',

    'As many people know that the shortest verse in the Bible is, [bible to="John 11:35" /], “Jesus wept.” He wept because He saw the sadness of those mourning the death of Lazarus, later He wept because the people in the city still didn’t believe Him and it was the week of His crucifixion. Also, we read in [bible to="Hebrews 5:7" /] that, “In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His piety.”',

    'So, weeping is okay, but as with most things, it’s about focus and moderation. Weeping becomes a distraction when we never find comfort in the “God of comfort” and when we’re never acquainted with Jesus who is “a Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief”. Things will hurt, maybe even for your whole life, but love God more than that hurt and one day, “He will wipe away every tear from [your] eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”',
