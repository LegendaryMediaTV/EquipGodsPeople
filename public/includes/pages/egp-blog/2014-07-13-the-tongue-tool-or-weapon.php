    'We all say things we shouldn’t, so much so that James says here that if you don’t ever fall short in your talking, that you’ve attained perfection. Now, this isn’t to say that, “not saying bad things is all that’s required,” but rather that, what comes out of your mouth is indicative of what’s in your heart, which controls all of your actions. Since the tongue is essentially directly connected to your heart, it is either a very powerful tool or weapon. Your life and even others’ lives can be dragged around by it, like in the horse example, or regardless of the storms you face, you can traverse the waters of life.'

    'More often than not, however, our tongue starts forest fires of destruction. Some people live their whole lives carrying the burden of “one small thing” said to them as a child (that the other person may not even remember saying). The things we say can open up spiritual doors on someone, often leading to a lifetime of demonic oppression. We can speak shame on someone, tell them to shut up, tell them that they’re stupid, worthless, and worse.'

    ') is the word we get “cosmos” directly from, and basically means “all of creation.” So, the idea here is that the things we say are the very universe in which sin resides. He goes on to say in the same verse that the tongue “defiles the entire body.” The word translated here as “defile” (',
