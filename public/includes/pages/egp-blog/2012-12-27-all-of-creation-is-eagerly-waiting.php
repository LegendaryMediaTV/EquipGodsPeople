    'When Adam sinned, he brought death into the world ([bible to="Romans 5:12" /]), not just for people, but for all of creation. Animals die, plants die, even stars die. So, what Paul is saying here is that everything that’s been created has suffered because of the fall. One of the punishments of the fall was great pain during childbirth ([bible to="Genesis 3:16" /]), so Paul compares the sufferings of all creation to those pains. But when Christ restores everything, it won’t just be people being restored, but all of creation ([bible to="2 Peter 3:10–13" /], [bible to="Revelation 21:5" /])!',

    'We received the indwelling of the Holy Spirit when we became believers as a pledge (or down-payment) of our future in the presence of God ([bible to="Ephesians 1:13–14" /]). But because of this, there also was implanted a strong desire for that time. We can call God, “Abba Father,” now, but that time is coming when we’ll inherit the full blessings of being His children ([bible to="Romans 8:14–17" /])! But not only that, we’ll also have redeemed and renewed bodies that aren’t subject to age, death, and decay ([bible to="1 Corinthians 15:42–44" /])!',

    '“In hope we have been saved.” Notice that this doesn’t say “we hope we have been saved…” but, “in hope…” [bible to="Hebrews 11:1" /] (NLT) says, “What is faith? It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. It is the evidence of things we cannot yet see.” In hope, through faith, we can now see a glimpse of what is unseen. Knowing that all of this isn’t just “opiate for the masses,” helps us to stay strong in our faith until the end, but at the same time, we just can’t wait to experience it fully!',
