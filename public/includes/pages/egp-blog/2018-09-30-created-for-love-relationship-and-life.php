There’s a HOLE, a HOLLOWNESS inside of their soul. And they’re trying to find the LIFE that is eluding them. And MAYBE along the way they concluded that life is found in GOD. …'

And so you spend your life CLIMBING and CLIMBING … TOILING and WORKING … TRYING to get to the top of that mountain so that you MIGHT ‘get to God,’ you MIGHT ‘find life.’ … EVERY religion gives us a construct to enlightenment, to nirvana, to Heaven, to God, to salvation, to WHATEVER ‘it’ is. … Jesus didn’t come to TELL us what WE need to do to get to God, Jesus came to SHOW us what GOD would do to get to US! …'

See, Jesus isn’t saying, ‘Look, I’m so EXCLUSIVE that I don’t want you trying ANYBODY ELSE.’ What He’s actually saying is, ‘I need you to understand, NO ONE ELSE is coming for you. … And why would you spend your ENTIRE LIFE trying to EARN the approval and love of a god who’s INDIFFERENT to you? Because, they DON’T EXIST and they’re NOT COMING for you.’ … THAT’S the power and wonder of who Jesus is. …',

If God needed us, then we should go FIND GOD. WE need God. … WE’RE the ones who are LOST. WE’RE the ones that need someone to SHOW US The Way. … You were not created to step into RELIGION, you were created for LOVE, for RELATIONSHIP, for LIFE.”'
