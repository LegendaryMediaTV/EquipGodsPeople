    'When we draw close to God, He will often reveal things to us ([bible to="Philippians 3:14-15" /]). Ironically, when having these deeper understandings, we can be filled with pride and start boasting in ourselves instead of God ([bible to="Romans 15:17-19" /]). So, God, still desiring to have closeness with us, allows for aspects of this fallen world to keep us humble. Paul compared it to being a thorn, literally, a splinter ([[strongs id="g4647" /]]) in his flesh. I don’t know if you’ve ever had a splinter lodged into you, but when you do, there may be times you can forget about it, but the wrong movement or brush of the skin will more than remind you that it’s there! Paul even said that it was there to torment him, literally, to “beat him up” ([[strongs id="g2852" /]]). ',

    'I always thought that only asking God three times to remove it seemed a bit undetermined. The word translated “implored” here literally means “to call near” ([strongs id="g3870" /]), so these were probably not just a morning prayer, but a time of seeking hard after God in prayer and fasting ([bible to="Luke 2:36-37" /]). Even still, he only asked three times because God clearly gave him the answer. While He does want us to keep asking, to keep knocking, and to keep seeking ([bible to="Matthew 7:7-8" /]), there are sometimes, contrary to the “prosperity gospel”, that the door is opened to reveal that this hard time IS where God wants you right now.',

    'So, what about “My grace is sufficient for you”? How could allowing something to come along and beat up on you be an extension of grace? The bottom line: there are NONE good except God ([bible to="Mark 10:18" /]), ALL have sinned and have earned death ([bible to="Romans 5:12" /]), so if the extent of your woes is that for your short time here on earth you will be reminded that you are a human in a broken world, that apart from Christ you are nothing, that He is your strength and hope, and that thanks to Him you will one day live in a restored world without sin and death, surrounded by God’s presence…then we should AT LEAST be content with the Grace He has extended to us! Also, the word translated “sufficient” here literally means “to ward off”! So, while God may allow us to go through tough times, His Grace WILL protect us through those tough times, allowing them to draw us closer to Him.',
