Because if your life isn’t where it “SHOULD” be, you “need to have MORE faith.” If anyone has ever told you that you need to have more faith, they’re saying the exact OPPOSITE of Jesus. … You may need more COURAGE, but you don’t need more FAITH. … because God can actually just SQUEEZE into that SMALL THING and create the BIG thing out of it. It’s not how much faith you HAVE, it’s WHAT you have faith in that matters. …'
