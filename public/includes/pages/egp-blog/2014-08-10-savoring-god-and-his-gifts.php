    'In today’s world, we’re so geared toward getting out of where we currently are to get to greener pastures that we’ve forgotten how to savor things. We’re so tied up in getting to the next destination that we don’t take the time to enjoy the journey. We speed along in our cars and whip out our phones to text and do social media any time there are two seconds to spare. Then, when we finally get to where we’re going, we’re so geared up from rushing there that we interpret it as boredom and play on our phones instead of being there in the moment with the people and things we came to see.'

    'Now, I love photography as much as the next guy, but in our “selfie” generation, we’re so geared up to “Instagram” our food or a sunset that we don’t remember to enjoy it for ourselves. In fact, studies have shown that people who take a snapshot of an experience instinctively rely on the photograph to “capture the moment” and remember it for us, that we don’t fully experience and absorb the emotions of the moment ourselves. On top of that, most people that do take the time to experience those moments will say, “photographs can’t do it justice.”'
