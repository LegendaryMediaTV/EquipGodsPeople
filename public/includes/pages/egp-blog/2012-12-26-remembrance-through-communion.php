    'Usually when people do communion (the Lord’s Supper), they either have a wafer, a small square of cracker bread, or people tear off a piece of normal bread. In Jewish culture, they use matzo (or matzah) bread (which is pretty much an over-sized cracker that’s about 4”–6” on either side). They don’t have leaven (yeast), which is symbolic of Christ being without sin ([bible to="Hebrews 4:15" /], [bible to="2 Corinthians 5:21" /]). One of the characteristics of matzoh bread is that it usually has darker stripes from being cooked, which is symbolic of the scourging Christ endured so “by His stripes we are healed” ([bible to="Mark 15:15" /], [bible to="Isaiah 53:5" /]). When using it for communion, people break off a piece, which is symbolic of Christ’s body being beaten and “crushed for our iniquities” ([bible to="Matthew 26:67" /], [bible to="Mark 15:19" /], [bible to="Isaiah 53:5" /]). This bread reminds us of what Christ endured as He took the punishment for our sins ([bible to="Romans 3:23–26" /]).',

    'The second part is “the fruit of the vine” ([bible to="Matthew 26:29" /]). The grapes are crushed to make the juice, which, like the bread, is symbolic of the beatings Christ endured in our place. People usually use grape juice nowadays, but originally it was wine. In fact, Paul got onto the Corinthian church for using this time of remembrance as an excuse to get drunk ([bible to="1 Corinthians 11:20–21" /]). Wine is usually referred to as a blessing in the Bible, which is symbolic of the blessings we have through Christ ([bible to="1 Corinthians 10:16" /]). It also has medicinal purpose, which is symbolic of Christ healing those who come to Him ([bible to="1 Timothy 5:23" /]). The fermentation of the wine preserves the wine, which is symbolic of our eternity with God that was gained through His sacrifice ([bible to="Isaiah 9:6" /]). Also, when Jewish priests provided wine for the original Passover ritual, they would often dilute the wine with water to prevent drunkenness, this is symbolic of the Holy Spirit (Living Water) working alongside Christ to bring salvation to us and bringing His sanctifying power ([bible to="Matthew 3:11" /], [bible to="John 3:5–6" /], [bible to="Titus 3:5" /]). And, of course, the wine is symbolic of Christ’s blood ([bible to="Luke 22:20" /]), which Hebrews tells us is is greater than that of any animal could ever be, because instead of just delaying punishment for sin and not dealing with our conscience, Christ’s blood washes away sin and cleanses our consciences from sin ([bible to="Hebrews 10:1–6" /], [bible to="Hebrews 9:11–14" /]).',
