    'People want a God of love ([bible to="1 John 4:16" /]), but then want to define what “love” means on their own terms. They also want to forget that He’s Holy and Righteous ([bible to="Isaiah 5:16" /]). Others will follow them because saying, “I can do whatever I want and will be okay in the end,” sounds great ([bible to="2 Timothy 4:3-4" /]). But those who lead others (especially children) down the wrong path in the Name of God will suffer the consequences ([bible to="Mark 9:42" /], [bible to="2 Peter 2:1-3" /], [bible to="Jude 1:4" /]).'

    'If you truly have Christ, there’s nothing you can do (or not do) to separate yourself from His love…nothing… ([bible to="Romans 8:35-39" /]) All the same, nothing you do (or don’t do) apart from Christ can bring you any closer to God…nothing… ([bible to="Romans 3:19-20" /]) In fact, [bible to="Isaiah 64:6" /] says, “…all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment…” which literally translates “filthy menstrual rags” (see [[strongs id="h5708" /]] and [[strongs id="h899" /]]). Jesus even said, “… No one is good except God alone.” ([bible to="Mark 10:18" /]).'

While it’s true that His sacrifice was for all ([bible to="1 Peter 3:18" /]), but it only saves “many” because not “all” will accept it ([bible to="John 1:11-13" /], [bible to="Matthew 20:28" /], [bible to="Matthew 26:28" /], [bible to="Romans 5:15" /]).'

This brings us back to the fact that we don’t obey God in order to be accepted by Him, but we obey God because we love Him ([bible to="John 14:15" /], [bible to="John 14:23-24" /]). If we are being willfully disobedient, then that shows our heart hasn’t been changed ([bible to="Romans 2:4-8" /], [bible to="Romans 10:26-27" /], [bible to="Titus 1:15-16" /]). These are the ones who will be saying “Lord, Lord” in the end and Christ will say, “I never knew you” ([bible to="Matthew 7:21-23" /]).'
