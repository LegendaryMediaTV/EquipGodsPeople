I regard everything as LOSS in comparison with Christ…in the sense that as I wear my coat, drive my car, watch a video, I will deal with this in a way that draws me MORE to Christ, not LESS to Christ. If the video undermines the PURE, SWEET fellowship with Jesus, rather than ENHANCING it, STOP WATCHING THEM!'

I’m APPALLED, not because I’m a PRUDE—I have my favorite movies—but because I am RUINED by certain scenes. I won’t watch certain “good” movies because of THAT scene. I will NOT, because CHRIST is dishonored in my SOUL and my MIND is contaminated for MONTHS, and HE’s more PRECIOUS than the pleasure of the other 124 MINUTES.'
