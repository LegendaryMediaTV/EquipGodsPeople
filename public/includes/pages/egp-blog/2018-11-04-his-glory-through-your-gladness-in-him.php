Father, grant me ENOUGH food—I don’t want to be RICH; GUARD ME from riches—grant me ENOUGH food so that I have life and breath IN ORDER TO hallow Your Name. Father, FORGIVE my sins, because, if I don’t have forgiveness from You, I’m gonna be swept away in CONDEMNATION, spend the rest of my life BLASPHEMING You in Hell rather than HALLOWING You in Heaven. Oh God, PLEASE forgive my sins and make me a FORGIVING PERSON. Father, keep me out of DESTRUCTIVE temptation that would RUIN my life and take away EVERY inclination I’ve EVER felt to hallow Your Name. Father, GUARD ME from the evil one, who wants more than ANYTHING that I would live for MY name and not YOURS.’ …'
