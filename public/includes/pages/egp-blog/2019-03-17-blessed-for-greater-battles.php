      '“The way we talk in our time and culture about being BLESSED by God, you’re blessed when you’re RICH. You’re blessed when you’re FAMOUS. You’re blessed when you’re SUCCESSFUL. You’re blessed when everything is going GREAT. You’re blessed when you’re COMFORTABLE, and SECURE, and SAFE. That’s the blessing. But [Joshua] blessed Caleb by giving him the BATTLE he was the ONLY ONE with the COURAGE to take on. Has it ever occurred to you that GOD’S blessing for your life is to send you into the BATTLE against GIANTS? … I want an inheritance that seems so OVERWHELMING and so OMINOUS that everyone else is AFRAID to take it on. How about you? …'

      '[Caleb] followed the [sc]Lord[/sc] with his WHOLE HEART, and so it took him into a GREATER BATTLE. … There’s NOTHING Jesus will ever call you to that will be LESS THAN what you’re facing right now. There’s NOTHING Jesus will ever take you into that you will actually have the power to overcome ALONE. He’s going to THROW YOU into the lion’s den—sometimes LITERALLY—and not make the lions COOPERATIVE, but you COURAGEOUS. … Jesus NEVER died so that we could SETTLE, He died so that we could be the greatest REVOLUTION humanity has ever known. …'

I will live a life that You CALL ME to live for 45 years, because I know YOU will come through.’”'
