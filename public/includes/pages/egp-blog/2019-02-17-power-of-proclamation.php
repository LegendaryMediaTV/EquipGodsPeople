For many people, their goal in life is to vent when they have something going wrong. And all they do is add to the strength of that particular problem. … I’m only going to talk if I am looking for a redemptive solution and I believe that they are a part of it. … I don’t mean you don’t seek council. … Living in denial is not the solution. But there are times where we actually fuel and feed conflicts and problems in life, … because they’re the topic of our complaint, the topic of our conversation. … Whatever you say, you’ll have. The problem is, we have much of what we’ve said. …'

But once we’ve received the Word of the [sc]Lord[/sc] in a given situation, it is up to us to make the proclamation that those things would come to pass. …',

I am going to harness my own conversation, and I’m going to make sure that I proclaim that which You are saying, God.’ … It’s almost like the proclamations are seating the cloud of the rain that’s actually going to fall upon my own life.”'
