    'The definition of God is something sought after by generations past and generations to come. The most used excuse for our lack of knowledge of God is limitations of humans. “There is only so much that the human mind can hold or handle.” Due to the boundaries of our cerebra, we are incapable of defining God with great accuracy. The danger of this thought process is being quick to regard things as impossible and placing great restrictions on what do we deem possible; thus, we undermine our competence and label Him “unknowable.” ([bible to="1 Corinthians 2:9–10" /])'

  new BS_Paragraph(
    null,
    'The primary stumbling block of the inner battle is a lack of faith toward God’s capabilities. Jesus, God’s very Son, constantly taught His disciples about trust in the limitlessness of God. This is verified in [bible to="Matthew 17:20" /] when He says, “…If you have faith the size of a mustard seed…nothing will be impossible to you.” (NASB)'
  ),

  new BS_Paragraph(
    null,
    'Throughout the entire Bible, the importance of unity is greatly stressed. In [bible to="Mark 3:24" /], Jesus tells the Pharisees, “If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.” (NASB) As the Body of Christ, we need to come together and share what God has revealed to us personally instead of each believer “reinventing the wheel” time after time. ([bible to="John 17:20–23" /])'
  ),

  new BS_Heading2(null, 'Eternal and timeless'),

  new BS_Paragraph(
    null,
    'God’s character demands that He be eternal. If He were created, He would have to have a creator, and anything that has a creator can be destroyed. ([bible to="1 Timothy 1:17" /]) The only way to overcome this is for God to have no beginning and no end. [bible to="Genesis 1:14" /] states, “Then God said, ‘Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.’” (NASB) God created time for us, not Himself. Therefore, since He created it, He is not subject to it. ([bible to="2 Peter 3:8" /])'
  ),

  new BS_Heading2(null, 'Infinite and limitless'),

  new BS_Paragraph(
    null,
    'God’s infiniteness as a being is due to the fact that He is spirit. ([bible to="John 4:24" /]) By implication, this means that He is not confined by the limitations of matter. Thus, He can choose to be invisible or to manifest Himself in any way He desires. ([bible to="Romans 1:20" /]) It is our responsibility as Christians to let it be known when God does manifest Himself, so that we can serve as a witness to all, especially the unbelievers.'

  new BS_Paragraph(
    null,
    'Instead of trying to wonder how God can be limitless (i.e., omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, eternal), we need to accept the fact that He is and “go on unto perfection” by being obedient and doing His divine will. ([bible to="Hebrews 6:1" /])'
  ),
