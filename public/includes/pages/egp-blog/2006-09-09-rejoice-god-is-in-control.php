    'Just ask yourself, “At what point did God lose control?” How can you argue with that? He’s GOD!!! He doesn’t lose control!!! He’s always caring for your every need. The Bible is here to remind us that God loves us. All He asks for in return is for us to obey him. EVERYTHING He asks our obedience in is for our well-being, not so we can be his slaves. Christ told us that we are no longer slaves, but friends. [bible to="John 15:14–15" /] tells us, “You are my friends if you obey me. I no longer call you servants, because a master doesn’t confide in his servants. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.”',

[bible to="Philippians 4:13" /] says, “For I can do everything with the help of Christ who gives me the strength I need.” Another way you could word it is “I can make it through anything with the help of Christ who gives me the strength I need.”',

    'I close with this, don’t try to be what other people want you to be or expect you to be. Instead, be what God wants you to be, and everything else will fall into place. Let the trials remind you to place your faith in God and not of the things of this world. Let them build your virtue (patience, peace, unconditional love for others, etc). Remember, no matter what happens in this life, God is in control and He loves you unconditionally with a love that surpasses our understanding. It’s a Father’s love for His child…times infinity and forever; a love so strong that Christ died to protect us. “And here is how to measure it—the greatest love is shown when people lay down their lives for their friends.” ([bible to="John 15:13" /])',
