And instead of just saying ‘[sc]Lord[/sc], SAVE me,’ you just start trying to swim in your OWN STRENGTH. … The reality is that you can get SO tired that you THINK you’ve hit the wall, but God is just WAITING to elevate you so that you actually perform at a HIGHER LEVEL with LESS EXERTION. There’s a place WAITING for you just past the drowning. … Maybe THAT’s why we keep missing our second wind, because we think the second wind is about US. The second wind is really about GOD revealing Himself IN us and THROUGH us.”',
