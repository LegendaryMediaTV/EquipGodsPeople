He said, ‘Do the DEEDS you did at first.’ …'

And the temptation is to COAST in your present breakthrough and live IGNORANT of the fact that that was just step ONE of MANY steps into the things that God LONGS to release into the earth. …'

Then you transplant it to ANOTHER pot and it grows until it fills THAT pot. That’s where WE’RE at. He’s EXPANDING our capacity. REVELATION KNOWLEDGE reveals areas where I have personal TRANSFORMATION coming and it reveals my INHERITANCE (what I must enter into through the EXPRESSION of faith).”'
