Just tell me WHICH ONE, and I’m happy. I LOVE Your will. It’s ALWAYS been good.’ There are sometimes I want to know HIS PLAN for my life. ‘Just SHOW ME what I’m SUPPOSED to do.’ And I’m standing here and I hear NOTHING. …'

I just went to Door A, walked through, and He was there on the OTHER SIDE going, ‘Good choice.’ … And sometimes He’s VERY clear. … He tells me EXACTLY what to do. But there are other times He just WON’T. And it’s not until I approach Door C and get my hand on the handle, He says, ‘B.’ And I go, ‘Alright, cool,’ and I take His direction. But He didn’t speak until I came to the MOMENT of decision.'

What I really ACHE for is the PERSON, to meet with HIM, have HIM speak to me. … See, I want Him to give me DETAILED INSTRUCTION—kind of like a SLAVE wants detailed instructions—and He’s wanting me to act as a SON who HE TRAINED to think like HE DOES.”'
