    'This past week I had someone ask me about my church affiliation and my theological tenets. To be honest, I’ve never posted anything about that on the site because I’ve felt that sometimes those doctrinal “lines in the sand” can be divisive and can turn people off from what you have to say completely because they don’t agree with part of it. Regardless, people do want to know, and I am not ashamed of what I believe, nor am I ashamed to admit that I don’t have it all figured out. So, for what it’s worth, here’s my answer…',

    'I don’t have a particular church affiliation (but I most often end up in Baptist or supposedly non-denominational ones). I think most (non-)denominations have certain doctrines or mindsets right that God preserves through them or He wouldn’t allow them to continue to exist. Unfortunately, however, they oftentimes will hold too fast to those beliefs or others and (purposely) segregate themselves, rather than living in diverse unity.',

For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.”',

We can try to explain this as a “Trinity” or “Triune God”, but Scripture never explicitly does, so I don’t. Unless I’m quoting someone, you’ll only hear God/Father/Abba, Jesus/Christ/Messiah/Son, and Holy Spirit / Spirit of God / Helper, etc. from me (not that I hold anything against those who do use the other terms).',

    'I believe that all are in need of salvation that can only come through Jesus Christ and is available to all because of His death on the cross for our sins ([bible to="Acts 4:10-12" /]). I believe that everyone has a chance to come to the Only True God (regardless of whether or not they have outright heard the Gospel from another person), but that their own sins often lead to a willful rejection of God in their hearts ([bible to="Romans 1:20-32" /]). There are those that hear this Word, declare that Jesus is Lord, and believe in their heart that He died for their sins and was raised from the dead ([bible to="Romans 10:8-10" /]). In the end, everyone will have to stand before Christ and will either have eternal life through Him ([bible to="John 14:6" /]), or death…eternal separation apart from His presence ([bible to="2 Thessalonians 1:6-10" /]).',

God has individually and uniquely equipped us to excel in certain areas, Spiritually. While we are still on this earth, we are to utilize the Spirit-given grace-gifts ([bible to="Ephesians 4:11-13" /], [bible to="Romans 12:4-8" /], [bible to="1 Corinthians 12:7-11" /], etc.). So, while we should all tell people about what God has done in our lives, some excel at evangelism…while we should all pray, some excel as intercessors, etc. While these gifts are supposed to be “for the common good” and provide diversity and unity, people often prioritize their gifting above the others (i.e., “if you don’t _____ then you’re not a true Christian”) and cause divisions ([bible to="1 Corinthians 12:14-27" /]).',
