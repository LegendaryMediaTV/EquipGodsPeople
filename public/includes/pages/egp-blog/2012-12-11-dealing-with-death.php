Those who put our trust in His saving power will be brought back to life (resurrected), never to die again, He’ll wipe away all our tears, and live with God for eternity.

Mary, Lazarus’ sister, met with Jesus and said “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” ([bible to="John 11:21" /]) Jesus told her “[sc]I Am[/sc] the Resurrection and the Life. Those who believe in Me, even though they die like everyone else, will live again. They are given eternal life for believing in Me and will never perish.” ([bible to="John 11:25–26" /])',

She came…RUNNING…fell at his feet and cried out the same words as her sister. “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” ([bible to="John 11:32" /]) When He saw her and the others weeping…He was torn inside…and began to weep too.',

So, it’s okay to weep and mourn over the death of a loved one, and you’ll probably miss them for the rest of your life here. But hold tight to the God of Comfort and look forward to the day of resurrection!',
