For some people that is in the “mission field” witnessing to people across the world, for others it is a call to preach or another church position, but others still it’s the seemingly less glorified mission of remaining faithful to God while working a secular job and being there for your family both physically and spiritually.',

But these times in the wilderness are never just periods of wandering aimlessly in the desert, they are times of preparation…a time of being faithful with where we are and with what we have, regardless of our knowledge or ignorance of the next step. These are the times where we are faithful with the few before being given the responsibility over much ([bible to="Matthew 25:21" /]), because when much is given, much is required ([bible to="Luke 12:48" /]). These are times of training for what’s to come!',

They must discipline their bodies by eating properly, sleeping properly, denying themselves of “good” things that aren’t directly helping them get closer to their goal ([bible to="2 Timothy 2:4" /]).

They train so that when the unexpected comes, they are able to handle it the best they can. They train hard because when the timer runs out it’s either a win or a loss, regardless of how close the score was. They train hard because when they cross the finish line, either they got first place or they just got some other place, regardless of whether it was neck-and-neck.',
