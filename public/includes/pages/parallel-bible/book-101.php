It has been called “the book of beginnings.” In fact, the word, “genesis” means, “source, origin, or genealogy” in Greek. This is an accurate description because Genesis covers everything from the creation of everything created through the lives of the forefathers of the faith: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.')
